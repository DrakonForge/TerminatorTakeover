Are Hytale's normal enemies starting to get old? Wish there were more giant evil death robots in the world to spice things up.

Well this one isn't giant, but it definitely falls under the other three!

The **Terminator** has arrived, and I'll give you three guesses as to what it does. A mechanical construct of unknown origins, these merciless terrors have begun their invasion of Orbis and must be stopped at all costs.

Its skeletal form is reminiscent of other Undead, but don't be fooled—it is strong, tough, and surprisingly quick. Not to mention, it's equipped with a number of combat protocols to deal with anything (and everything) it comes across.

Oh, and it is hostile to everything. Yes, *everything*. If you come across a field of scattered mob drops, watch out—odds are a Terminator might still be nearby, with its murderous cravings no less sated.

Their sudden appearance in Orbis raises mysterious questions. Who originally constructed it? Where did it come from? How has it managed to spread across nearly every zone in Orbis? Alas, most adventurers who attempt to study Terminators in closer detail end up taking the quick route back to their workbenches.

## Design Notes

Terminators are designed as a mid-game challenge and will prove a threat even to highly-geared adventurers. They appear in select biomes across all zones, typically where more challenging enemies already spawn.

Spawn rates are slightly increased for the purposes of the jam. You can also spawn one manually in with `/npc spawn DrakonForge_Terminator`.

*This mod is an entry for the first HytaleModding Mod Jam, with the theme "Echoes of the Machine". It was created in about a day, and does not quite meet the quality standard I typically set for my mods. I hope you enjoy it nonetheless!*
